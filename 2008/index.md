The following two projects were undertaken as part of GSoC 2008:

### Wall control
Student: Mokhtar M. Khorshid  
Mentor: Julian Smart

The project unfortunately didn't achieve its goals and wxWallCtrl is still
not available for the general use.

[SVN branch](http://trac.wxwidgets.org/browser/wxWidgets/branches/SOC2008_WXWALLCTRL)

### Fixing bugs in wxGTK and wxMSW
Student: Marcin Wojdyr  
Mentor: Vadim Zeitlin

This project was very successful, a huge number of bugs, including a lot of
inconsistencies between the platforms, was fixed and a lot of unit tests added.
