![Google Summer of Code 2013](2013/logo.jpg)

[Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/),
abbreviated GSoC, is an amazing program organized by Google which offers
students stipends for working on open source projects. This year GSoC has
been announced on February 11 and [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org) will
apply as a mentoring organization.

While the final decision will only be known on April 8, we are already looking
for motivated students to work with us during this summer, either on one of
our own [project ideas for 2013](2013) or on a project you are particularly
interested in and would like to propose to us.

Please contact us by posting to [wx-dev mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/group/wx-dev) if you would like to get
involved. Looking forward to hearing from you!

### Why Participate in GSoC with wxWidgets?

Generally speaking, GSoC is a great opportunity to start in the world of open
source development if you are curious about it or would like to improve your
programming skills. Here are some reasons to specifically choose wxWidgets as
your mentoring organization:

- **wxWidgets has a friendly community of developers** -
    We will welcome you warmly and do our best to help you to get up to speed
    quickly and you can always rely on getting answers to your questions on
    our mailing list.

- **wxWidgets is a popular, widely used library** -
    It is used by thousands of people and companies (including some that you
    might know, such as [Intel](http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2012/08/did-you-know-that-intel-vtune-used.html),
    Dropbox and [Google](https://plus.google.com/+wxwidgets/posts/1ms9xR7nEDD))
    so the code you will work on will get a lot of visibility and will gain
    you a lot of kudos from other developers, even those not using C++
    themselves as wxWidgets is also the basis of
    [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/), [wxPerl](http://www.wxperl.it/),
    [wxRuby](http://wxruby.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl),
    [wxHaskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell),
    [wxLua](http://wxlua.sourceforge.net/) and many other languages GUI
    libraries.

- **We propose some great [projects](2013) for you to work on** -
    For example, porting wxWidgets API to Android or iOS are definitely very
    exciting -- albeit quite challenging -- tasks. Other ones might be less
    innovative but you would still be creating something new and make it
    possible to do things that hadn't been practical before in cross-platform
    programs.

- **We have participated in six previous GSoCs** -
    So we have quite some experience of mentoring students. In fact, some of
    the potential mentors are students themselves and will be able to help you
    effectively.

- **wxWidgets is a representative example of a big, mature C++ project** -
    Working on its code base will undoubtedly help you to work on other
    real-life projects in the industry in the future.

### What Should I Do Next?

Once you have found a project that interests you, or if you have your own 
suggestion, you should read through the [student guidelines](student-guidelines)
page. Especially important are contacting the wx-dev mailing list and submitting
some simple patches to the project. When writing your application please keep the
[application template](application-template) and deadline in mind, good luck!
