## Improve wxiOS port

A previous GSoC project has created the basics of a wxWidgets port to iOS. The
task for this year would be to make this port really usable and complete the
missing parts.

In particular the [wxiOS branch](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/tree/SOC2011_WXIOS),
in which all the work had been done up to now, would need to be merged into the
mainline and all standard controls would need to be implemented. Note that
part of this project -- which ideally should be done before submitting the
proposal to work on it -- would consist of building the existing wxiOS sources
and ascertaining its current state.
