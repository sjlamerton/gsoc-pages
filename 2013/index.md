![2013 Summer of Code Project Ideas](logo.jpg)

Here is a preliminary list of the projects we plan to propose this year.
Please notice that this list is still being updated and, also, that it is not
exclusive, i.e. you can perfectly well propose to work on the projects which
are not listed here -- but please post to [wx-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/wx-dev)
to discuss them first if you plan to do it.

The projects are sorted roughly in order of their
[importance](../project-ratings):

* **[wxAndroid](../projects/android):** Start the work on a port to Android.
* **[wxiOS](../projects/ios):** Continue the porting project started during
  GSoC 2011.

  wxWidgets standards.
