![2013 Summer of Code Project Ideas](logo.jpg)

Google Summer of Code 2013 hasn't officially started yet but here is a
preliminary list of the projects we plan to propose this year if we are
accepted as a mentoring organization.

Please notice that this list is still being updated and, also, that it is not
exclusive, i.e. you can perfectly well propose to work on the projects which
are not listed here -- but please post to
[wx-dev mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/wx-dev) to discuss them
first if you plan to do it.

The projects are sorted roughly in order of their
[importance](../project-ratings):

* **[wxAndroid](../projects/android):** Start the work on a port to Android.
* **[wxiOS](../projects/ios):** Continue the porting project started during
  GSoC 2011.
* **[wxUniv](../projects/universal):** Bring the wxUniv port up to current
  wxWidgets standards.
* **[wxWebView](../projects/webview):** A few ideas all around
  [wxWebView](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_web_view.html).
* **[Direct2D-based wxGraphicsContext](../projects/gc-d2d):** Provide an implementation
  of [wxGraphicsContext](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_graphics_context.html)
  for Windows using [Direct2D](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370987.aspx).
* **[Power Management](../projects/power-management):** Cross platform support
  for power management events.
* **[Cross Platform System Sound](../projects/sound):** Provide a way to play
  various "system sounds".
* **[wxAUI Native Art Providers](../projects/aui-native-art):** Make wxAUI
  blend in better with native rendering methods on each platform.
* **[wxRichTextCtrl Enhancements](../projects/rtc):** Several projects related
  to [wxRichTextCtrl](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_rich_text_ctrl.html).
* **[wxFileSystem](../projects/filesystem):** Improve our virtual file system
  abstraction.

Alternatively, you could decide to select a project depending on your
background, so that if you are a...

* Windows programmer -- then you could help us with
  [Direct2D-based wxGraphicsContext](../projects/gc-d2d)
* Linux hacker -- then you could be interested in cross-platform
  [power management](../projects/power-management) or
  [system sound](../projects/sound) projects.
* Mac guru -- then, in addition to the two projects above, you could be
  interested in [wxiOS](../projects/ios).
* Mobile enthusiast -- then either [wxAndroid](../projects/android) or
  [wxiOS](../projects/ios) could be exciting for you.
* Web/JavaScript developer -- then you should have a look at one of
  [wxWebView](../projects/webview) projects.
* Somebody else -- tell us what could be interesting for you!
